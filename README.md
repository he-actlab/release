# ReLeASE Optimizing Compiler

This repository contains the open-source contribution regarding the following submission to NeurIPS 2019.
"Reinforcement Learning and Adaptive Sampling for Optimized DNN Compilation" <br/>

We integrate our optimizing compiler into TVM, Open deep learning compiler stack for cpu, gpu and specialized accelerators.

__NOTE__

We make a custom implementation of PPO, making it more portable. <br/>
Internal implementation is from another repo, and the idea about the architecture is from TensorForce. <br/>
PPO Implementation: https://github.com/uidilr/ppo_tf <br/>
